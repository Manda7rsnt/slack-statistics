# slack-statistics

**slack-statistics** is a clean and simple display board for your Slack team.
* Made with JavaScript and the Slack API
* Counts the number of messages posted by your team members
* Provides a range of day-by-day insights

## How to use

1. Fill in the `slackToken` variable (in `stats.js`) with your own Slack token. Make sure to use a string!
2. Navigate to the location of `index.html` in your browser.
3. You're ready to go! If data doesn't appear, check your token has been entered correctly.

## How it works
Brief explanation of how `stats.js` works, to be added as part of documentation

## Getting a token

* You can grab a test token from [here](https://api.slack.com/docs/oauth-test-tokens). Please note the following warning:

> Test tokens are just for you. Never share test tokens with other users or applications. Do not publish test tokens in public code repositories. Review token safety tips.
